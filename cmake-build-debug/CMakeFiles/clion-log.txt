CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

CMake Warning (dev) in C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2021.3.4/bin/cmake/win/share/cmake-3.21/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:
  Policy CMP0011 is not set: Included scripts do automatic cmake_policy PUSH
  and POP.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0011" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  The included script

    C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2021.3.4/bin/cmake/win/share/cmake-3.21/Modules/FindBoost.cmake

  affects policy settings.  CMake is implying the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option for
  compatibility, so the effects are applied to the including context.

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
